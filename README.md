Hi, I am currently a student at The University of Washington Bothell, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I'm passionate about exploring how design and code come together to make meaningful experiences. I'm always eager to learn from others, expand my skillset, and grow both technically and personally. Looking forward to connecting and learning from diverse perspectives in the tech world.

This folder will demonstrate all the skills and practices I have developed through my journey of innovation!
